    For whatever reason, you have come to the conclusion that I need to learn how to write software!
More often than not, your first choice is Which programming language should I learn? After further research, you discover a plethora of online courses, coding bootcamps, and Hello World! tutorials. You start to raise questions: What are the best courses? Should I enroll in classes? Why are bootcamps so expensive?
You become stagnant, overwhelmed by the wealth of information and choice.

    <p>Hello, I&rsquo;m Amy, a Doctor of Pharmacy (PharmD).</p>
<p>I created this website to understand more about technology and its impact on my profession.
I will use this forum as a medium to create blogs that share my learnings.
My first lesson was to figure out how-the-heck to create a blog post and publish it to the Internet.</p>
