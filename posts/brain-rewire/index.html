  <p>To help rewire the brain as a developer, I like to think in terms of bubbles.
One starts with the first all-encompassing bubble, the <em><strong>Application</strong></em> itself.
But what is an application?
How can we start to break it down?</p>
<p>Most people think of an application as purely software written in some programming language.
Typically overlooked, an application must also consider its target environment (or platform).
For example, let&rsquo;s take the word processor application <em><strong>Microsoft Word</strong></em>.
It can run on many different platforms, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Microsoft Windows for PCs (or Personal Computers);</li>
<li>Apple macOS for Mac computers;</li>
<li>Apple iOS for iPhone;</li>
<li>Android for Linux-based smartphones and tablets; and</li>
<li>even Web browsers.</li>
</ul>
<p>In essence, one might consider Microsoft Word as a single application capable of running on every platform.
However, one cannot simply take an application targeting Microsoft Windows and expect it to run on an iPhone.
Actually, it&rsquo;s many different applications, each written in a language targeting the platform.
For example, the Microsoft Windows version is written in <em><strong>C++</strong></em>, where the iOS version is <em><strong>Objective-C</strong></em>.
This often explains why an application running on one platform, might not look-and-feel the same as on another.
It&rsquo;s because it&rsquo;s a different application, most likely written by a different team of developers.</p>
<p>So when we think of an <em><strong>Application</strong></em>, we can split it into two bubbles:</p>
<ol>
<li>Software - written in a programming language and bundled for a target environment; and</li>
<li>Platform - where the bundled application is downloaded, installed, and run.</li>
</ol>
<p>Next, we will continue to breakdown an application and split these bubbles further, starting with <em><strong>Software</strong></em>.</p>
